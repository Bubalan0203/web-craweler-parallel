  - Achieves 7x+ performance improvement over sequential
  - Configurable concurrent request limits
  - Connection pooling for optimal performance

- **Improved Threading**
  - Better ThreadPoolExecutor implementation
  - Configurable worker count
  - Resource cleanup and management

#### Error Handling
- **Comprehensive error handling** throughout the application
  - Automatic retry logic with configurable attempts
  - Specific exception handling for timeouts, connection errors, and HTTP errors
  - Detailed error logging with context
  - Graceful degradation on failures

- **Request resilience**
  - Configurable timeout values
  - Retry with exponential backoff for async requests
  - Connection error recovery
  - Network failure handling

#### Architecture Improvements
- **Configuration Module** (`config.py`)
  - Centralized configuration management
  - Environment variable support
  - Type-safe configuration using dataclasses
  - Separate configs for crawler, database, and app

- **Database Service** (`database.py`)
  - Supabase integration for data persistence
  - Session tracking and historical data
  - Optional - application works without it
  - Comprehensive statistics and analytics

- **Enhanced Flask Application** (`app.py`)
  - Better route organization
  - API endpoints for sessions and statistics
  - Health check endpoint
  - Proper error handlers (404, 500)
  - Structured logging

#### User Interface
- **Modern Web Interface**
  - Beautiful gradient-based design
  - Responsive layout with Bootstrap 5
  - Interactive charts using Chart.js
  - Tabbed results view for easy comparison
  - Real-time performance metrics display
  - Visual status indicators
  - Success/failure rate tracking

- **Enhanced Data Visualization**
  - Bar charts for execution time comparison
  - Doughnut charts for success/failure distribution
  - Detailed performance metrics badges
  - Response time tracking per URL

#### Testing
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**
  - `test_crawler.py`: 15+ test cases for crawler functionality
  - `test_config.py`: 10+ test cases for configuration
  - Mock-based testing for external dependencies
  - Edge case coverage
  - Retry logic testing
  - Error handling validation

#### Documentation
